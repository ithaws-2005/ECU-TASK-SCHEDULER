The ECU is the brain of any Electric Vehicle. In real time when multiple sensor outputs reach the ECU , it has two ways to handle it. Either it can loop over all the tasks in order or it can prioritise the tasks which also known as 'task scheduling'. The latter method is more efficient and safer for the vehicle. This project is aimed at developing a task scheduler for a car ECU by considering inputs from various sensors and prioritising them with respect to how critical the task is for the car.
